## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- npm or yarn

### Steps to Run the Application
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kottab
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure database connection string: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/kottab?schema=public"`
   - Set required authentication variables: `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL`

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   # or for first-time setup with seed data:
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- Database connection errors: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
- Prisma client issues: Run `npx prisma generate` to update the client
- Environment variable problems: Verify `.env` file is in the project root
- Authentication errors: Check that `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` are properly set

### Frontend-Only Testing Mode
For testing without a database connection, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_ONLY=true` in your `.env` file.

- Regular User: Email: `demo@example.com`, Password: `password123`
- Teacher: Email: `teacher@example.com`, Password: `password123`
- Admin: Email: `admin@example.com`, Password: `password123`
